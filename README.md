# Hangman Game
An interactive Hangman game with a hangman visual. The user is able to input a letter in order to try to guess letters that complete a word. If the user is unable to complete the word, the user loses and can choose to quit or play a new game. It's the same way if the user is able to complete the word: If the user completes the word, the user wins and can choose if they want to quit or play a new game.
